unified-code-format
===================

A utility for maintaining unified code formatting settings.

The idea is to provide a set of minimum common denominator formatting settings for java.
These settings should be exportable to all of the major IDEs.
IDEs which have more settings should be provided with defaults which makes them compatible to other IDEs.

This will provide a way for companies and teams to let developers use whatever IDE they prefer and still maintain a standardized code formatting standard.
